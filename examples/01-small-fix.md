# Example 01 — small fix: pagination shows one item too few

A small, well-understood bug. The point of this example is the **scope-gate keeping it lean**:
`small` skips the plan-gate *loop*, runs a single reviewer, and goes straight to the commit-gate —
the same hard stops as a `large` run, none of the fan-out cost.

---

```
/kimiflow  the products list shows 19 items per page but the page size is set to 20
```

### ⚪ Phase 0 — Setup, routing & scope-gate

- Routing: a reproducible "shows the wrong number" symptom → **fix mode**.
- Scope-gate: one file, one obvious off-by-one, no architectural risk → **`small`**.
  Announced: *"Scope: small — single reviewer, no plan-gate loop, no worktrees."*
- State dir: `.kimiflow/pagination-off-by-one/`.

### 🔵 Phase 1 — Clarify (problem)

Two questions only (small scope keeps the grill short):

1. *Expected: exactly `pageSize` items on a full page?* → yes, 20.
2. *Repro?* → open `/products` with ≥40 rows, count the first page → 19.

→ `PROBLEM.md` (symptom · repro · expected). ✋ **"Does this match?"** → confirmed.

### 🟣 Phase 2 — Diagnose

- Reproduces it: a unit test asserting `page(1).length === 20` over 40 rows → **fails, gets 19**.
- Proves the cause, doesn't guess:

  ```
  src/products/paginate.ts:42
    const start = (page - 1) * pageSize;
    const end   = start + pageSize - 1;   // ← off-by-one: slice end is exclusive
    return rows.slice(start, end);
  ```

  `Array.prototype.slice(start, end)` is end-**exclusive**, so `+ pageSize - 1` drops the last row.
- ⛔ **Diagnose-gate:** root cause is proven at `paginate.ts:42`, with the language semantics named →
  cleared. (No proof here would have meant **no fix**.)

→ `DIAGNOSIS.md`. No vault/web research needed — the cause is local and certain.

### ⚫ Phase 3 — Plan

Minimal. One task, one acceptance criterion (fix mode → "the reproduction no longer fails"):

- `PLAN.md`: change the slice bound in `paginate.ts`; no API change, no new file.
- `ACCEPTANCE.md`:
  - `AC-1` — *WHEN a full page is requested over N ≥ pageSize rows, THE list SHALL return exactly
    `pageSize` items.* → `paginate.spec.ts › returns a full page of pageSize`.

### 🟡 Phase 4 — Plan-gate (small → 1 reviewer, no loop)

One adversarial reviewer (lens B, risk), fresh context, sees `PLAN.md` + `ACCEPTANCE.md` +
`PROBLEM.md` + the named code. Writes findings to `findings/r1-B.md`:

```
NONE
```

Gate: `resolve-review-gate.sh findings --round 1 --expect B` → `clean⇥0⇥clean⇥…` → **0 open ✅**.
Small scope → no second round, no loop.

### 🟠 Phase 5 — Implement (TDD)

- The Phase-2 reproduction is already the red test → keep it.
- Fix:

  ```diff
  - const end = start + pageSize - 1;
  + const end = start + pageSize;
  ```
- Surgical: one line, traces directly to the diagnosis. Nothing else touched.

### 🟤 Phase 6 — Verify

- `npm test -- paginate.spec.ts` → `✓ returns a full page of pageSize (20)` — the reproduction now
  passes.
- Regression: full suite green.
- Goal-backward: AC-1's test exists, is substantive, and is wired (imported + run). Done ≠ done-only.

### 🟢 Phase 7 — Code-review → commit-gate

- One `senior-reviewer` over the 1-line diff + `ACCEPTANCE.md` (correctness only, not style; also
  *"was a test weakened to go green?"* → no). → `CODE-REVIEW.md`: clean.
- ✋ **Commit-gate — STOP.** Shows the summary, `git status`, `git diff --staged`:

  ```
  fix(products): paginate slice end is exclusive — return full pageSize per page

   src/products/paginate.ts        | 2 +-
   src/products/paginate.spec.ts   | 14 ++++++++++
  ```

  Waits for your **explicit OK**. On OK → commits the two named paths only (no `git add -A`, no
  AI-attribution trailer). **Never auto-commits.**

---

**Why this is the cheap path:** same diagnose-gate and commit-gate as a large run, but the scope-gate
dropped the second reviewer, the plan-gate loop and any worktrees. Lean work stays lean.
