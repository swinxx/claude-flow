# kimiflow demo — SCRIPTED ILLUSTRATION of the gate-refusal moments, NOT a captured
# model run. Dramatises four times kimiflow says "no", anchored in the real mechanisms
# (commit-gate STOP · resolve-review-gate open-findings · diagnose rule · test-weakening
# scan FLAG). Rendered to a GIF by kimiflow-demo.tape. For a REAL run, see README.md.
